# AVIP
AVIP is a visual communication system designed for autonomous vehicles to interact safely and clearly with pedestrians. It uses graphic signs to show things like: that the vehicle detects a pedestrian, what the vehicle intends to do next

In normal traffic, pedestrians rely on subtle non-verbal cues like eye contact, gestures, or a driver's posture to decide when it's safe to cross. But with autonomous vehicles, those human signals are gone — and that can lead to confusion, hesitation, or even a feeling of danger.

AVIP aims to fill that gap.

By clearly displaying what the vehicle “sees” and how it plans to react, AVIP helps pedestrians feel safer and more confident when interacting with AVs. It’s about rebuilding trust through transparency, using simple, intuitive visual cues.

Chyba brzmi dobrze, ale jak coś to pozwalam trochę zmienić
